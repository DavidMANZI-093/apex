# Technical PR: Modernize Frontend Architecture and Data Management

## Overview
This PR modernizes our frontend architecture by introducing a new data-driven approach and improving code organization. The changes are organized into several logical batches for clarity.

## Batch 1: Data Management Infrastructure

### New Data Files
- Created `src/data/stats.json`: Comprehensive statistics about company achievements and metrics
- Created `src/data/team.json`: Team member profiles with structured data
- Created `src/data/testimonials.json`: Client testimonials with ratings and structured metadata
- Created `src/data/values.ts`: Core company values with icon integration

### Changes Summary
- Centralized data management in dedicated JSON/TS files
- Added structured data schemas for consistent data handling
- Improved data reusability across components
- Enhanced type safety with TypeScript interfaces

## Batch 2: Type Definitions and Interfaces

### New Type Definitions
- Created `src/types/index.ts`:
  - `CardProps`: Standard interface for card components
  - `CardExProps`: Extended card properties for detailed content
  - `CardSxProps`: Service/sector card properties
  - `CardTxProps`: Testimonial card properties

### Changes Summary
- Added comprehensive type definitions for component props
- Improved type safety across the application
- Standardized prop interfaces for consistent component usage
- Enhanced IDE support with proper TypeScript types

## Batch 3: Code Quality and Maintenance

### Code Improvements
- Improved `src/utils/dev-tools.ts`:
  - Enhanced logging functionality with better formatting
  - Added proper TypeScript support
  - Improved console output readability

- Updated `tsconfig.json`:
  - Added `allowImportingTsExtensions` for better TypeScript support
  - Maintained strict type checking
  - Kept existing configuration while adding new features

### Changes Summary
- Enhanced code maintainability
- Improved development experience
- Added better TypeScript support
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Batch 4: Infrastructure Updates

### Middleware Improvements
- Updated `src/middleware.ts`:
  - Improved code formatting and consistency
  - Maintained existing functionality
  - Added proper TypeScript support

### Changes Summary
- Minor improvements to middleware configuration
- Better code organization
- Maintained existing functionality while improving code quality

## Technical Considerations

### Breaking Changes
- No breaking changes introduced
- All existing functionality maintained
- Backward compatibility preserved

### Testing
- Manual testing recommended for new data-driven components
- Type checking improvements should be verified
- Middleware functionality should be tested in development environment

### Future Work
- Consider adding more type definitions as needed
- Potential for further data centralization
- Possible improvements to logging system

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Verify data file structure and content
- [ ] Check type definitions for completeness
- [ ] Review middleware configuration
- [ ] Test logging functionality
- [ ] Verify TypeScript configuration
